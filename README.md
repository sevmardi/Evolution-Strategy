# Evolution Strategy

Evolution Strategy (ES) in MATLAB according to the generational ES algorithm that search for a real-valued vector of length 30, which represents the thickness of each layer in a 30-layered optical system.

For testing we use the following remarks: 

* 30,000 function evaluations for each run,
* Averaged over 20 runs
